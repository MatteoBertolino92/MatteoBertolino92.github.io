title:  "The Derby of Static Software Testing: Joern vs. CodeQl"
---

## Summary

Albeit I have to confess that my first temptation when looking for bugs in a source code file is to start to grep for `memcpy` or similar things, recently I had fun with two awesome tools for static software testing, namely, [Joern](https://joern.io/) and [CodeQl](https://codeql.github.com/). Both the tools share a similar phylosophy, that is, exporting an expressive domain-specific language to capture some code patterns and let the analyst interact with the code. In this quick blogpost, I will present some of the differences that I noticed when playing with the two tools, trying to give some indications and use-cases for each of the two.

## Performances and easy-of-use features

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
