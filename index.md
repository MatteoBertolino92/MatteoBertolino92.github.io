# Matteo Bertolino's homepage <img src="https://matteobertolino92.github.io/assets/photo.png" width="80" height="100" style="float: right;" alt="" />

I am Matteo Bertolino, currently employed at Renault Group as a Technical Leader in Safety Software. In my previous roles, I worked as a Senior Engineer at Huawei Technologies and pursued a Ph.D. at Télécom Paris.

My research interests encompass embedded systems, automotive engineering, kernel-related topics (Linux, Zephyr RTOS, LiteOS, FreeBSD, and similar systems), and modeling (Simulink).

While I have a passion for tech, I am not defined solely by my job. I also enjoy cold immersions (have you heard of the Wim Hof method?), downhill cycling in the forest, working out, and spending quality time with my wonderful family.

# My blog's articles

My new year resolutions include dedicating some time to a blogpost page, where I can share both technicals and more general-purpose things. This is still **very** WIP, but refresh this page from time to time for updates.
